If vaccine protection is transient or increasingly ineffective as new variants emerge, or if a substantial number of our fellows remain available to keep it propagating, then we’ll need ongoing public health measures for everyone’s protection. We can certainly try incentives first, but at some point there will have to be mandates much like there are for public school attendance. Ideally vaccines will also need formal approvals beyond EUA’s.

We should also remember that some of those vaccinated won’t be adequately protected. People who’ve had strong chemotherapy or take powerful immunosuppressives for autoimmune diseases or have one of the many congenital immune deficiencies (and there are millions) can safely get a vaccine that’s not a live virus, but can still remain extremely vulnerable to Covid.

As an MIT-educated biologist, I know data. And data shows that Delta is not some new scary thing but rather just another version of the same disease we have been dealing with for 18 months.

In the short term, unvaccinated employees prolong the pandemic and endanger not just themselves but their customers and coworkers as well.

Restaurants can usually accommodate rules about separation of tables, though sometimes at the cost of capacity and therefore of revenue.  But a bar that required its patrons to observe social distancing would have a very hard time operating at all.

""In Maryland, 12 percent of new cases last month...""
""....and in Colorado, 9 percent...""

Where are the real 'focal points' and 'clusters'?  Swimming pools?  Money?  Toilet plumes?  Schools?  The answers are known, but they aren't exciting or fear-inducing so they go unmentioned.  In the meantime just stay away from bars, restaurants, water (of all kinds...the virus monsters are very afraid of water in any form), cash, toilets and schools.  That should just about take care of the virus.

Oh...wait....the US average death rate per 100,000 from COVID is about to overtake Sweden's.  What's the NYT going to say then?",unclear,pro-mitigation,anti-mitigation,unclear

All the good and decent people in a work environment should not be put in harms way because the Republicans are too brainwashed to do what everyone knows needs to happen without being forced.",unclear,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"Unvaccinated worker(s) at a Kentucky nursing home recently caused an outbreak that infected several fully-vaccinated residents and a few fully-vaccinated staff. While the vaccine caused most of these infections to be asymptomatic or mild, one fully-vaccinated resident died. Perhaps employers who are skittish about being sued should consider that lawsuits may equally come from fully vaccinated employees.",unclear,unclear,anti-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"The vaccine mandate is about an individual not infecting their co-workers, families, and friends. My two Pfizer COVID shots have returned my confidence in my own safety and allowed me to intermingle with my family after a year of isolation. I am very grateful to the scientists who worked diligently and used their hard earned knowledge in a historic effort to save mankind from a horrific, very deadly disease.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"Fully vaccinated American here. Many of the extremist comments on this article are baffling and shocking. Requiring proof of vaccination before treating for Covid-19? Wow. Demanding to know whether all employees have been vaccinated before you'll enter any business (or any building, for that matter)? That's ridiculous. You want strangers' personal health information? Good luck getting that. Did you know businesses hire new people all the time? Covid-19 isn't going away. Are you going to demand vaccine information all the time, forever, now? What about booster vaccinations? Are you going to demand proof of boosters for previously vaccinated strangers? The comments praising the Big Brother aspect of this are especially disturbing. I have to wonder if there are professional trolls here, egging people on to have extremist viewpoints.",unclear,anti-mitigation,anti-mitigation,anti-mitigation
"It's maddening that certain scientists and health officials make statements regarding peoples reticence towards mask wearing. The science must be solely concerned with the proper thing to do to curb the virus, no matter how the public might react. Because if there's one thing that matters it's that we must all trust in the objectivity of science and not the subjectivity of politicians, business owners, and numerous others. This is not to say that the scientists and health care officials ought to bury their heads in the sand regarding the public's reactions. On the contrary, I think it was bone headed of the CDC to say that fully vaccinated people could cease wearing a mask. That statement opened a door that is difficult to shut. The CDC should have simply stated that fully vaccinated people were well protected. Then let others, Mayors, Governors, etc, modify any rules re mask wearing.",pro-mitigation,unclear,unclear,anti-mitigation
