Many who question the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines are misinterpreting the data. For example, people confuse a vaccine’s 95% efficacy rate from a controlled study with the notion that 5 out of 100 vaccinated people in the general population are vulnerable to breakthrough infection. Not so.

Real-world breakthrough infections are reported by The Lancet as the following percentages per vaccine: 0.9% for the Pfizer–BioNTech, 1% for the Gamaleya, 1·4% for the Moderna–NIH, 1·8% for the J&J, and 1·9% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccines. In the real world, the odds of a vaccinated person becoming infected are between 1 and 2 out of 100. And when infection happens, the vaccines practically eliminate the progression of advanced Covid requiring hospitalization.

The last unknown, asymptomatic infection, has not emerged among the vaccinated. And, the mRNA vaccines can handle the variants so far. Put all this together with the vaccines’ excellent safety record, and the case for vaccination is overwhelming.

"My primary and often-only source of information through this pandemic has been the New York Times. 

By the very data you presented, all but 2360 of the 133,243 cases in Louisiana since March have been in nursing homes or prisons. 

With this data, you presented a story suggesting that bars and restaurants are dangerous places for outbreaks (“outbreaks” being defined as “2 or more cases among unrelated individuals that have visited a site within a 14-day period”.)

This means:
•1.8% of all cases in Louisiana are not in a nursing home or prison.
•Less than 0.45% of all cases in Louisiana occur in places like restaurants and bars. 

None of this addresses the misleading definition/presentation of “outbreak”. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the definition of an outbreak in this case is literally “as few as 2 people who don’t know each other who contracted the coronavirus who went to the same restaurant or bar within 14 days of each other.”

I’m sure I’m missing something here, but at the very least something isn’t right...and I find it incredibly disappointing and irresponsible that that something is coming from The New York Times.",pro-mitigation,,unclear,unclear,unclear

My employer is going to put me in a position in which required vaccines forces me into a choice that could threaten my life, and could do so EVERY YEAR with new variants, boosters, etc. I have known allergies to substances found in the vaccine, and there are plenty of cases in which a person with allergies to things like shellfish are at risk for severe allergic reaction. We're talking anaphylaxes shock, and no you do not always recover from this simply by using an epi-pen.

So yes, I'm now going to lose my job over Big Pharma managing to lobby for full FDA approval, even though phase 3 trials for the vaccine are not set to end until 2013, and because even though if I get COVID-19 i'm more than 99% likely to recover from the illness. I am NOT as likely to avoid adverse reactions to the vaccine. 

I cannot bet my life to save my job, and I'm not alone.
