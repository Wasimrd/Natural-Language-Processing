"Will answer since my kid currently goes to daycare and has been for two and a half months now. My reasons are two-fold.

One: We were (somewhat) comfortable going back because of the precautions our day care is taking and the relative size. I would guess they've got maybe 50-60 kids in attendance on a daily basis right now, broken up into five different classrooms that have their own spaces/rooms. It's the same kids everyday, the same teacher every day, with minimal cross pollination between classrooms. Temperature checks for everyone every morning and occasionally throughout the days. Tons of hand washing and sanitizing. They shortened their hours to institute a ton of cleaning. Masks are required for anyone older than two when they're not in their classroom with people they see everyday and for teachers and administrators at all times. Parents are not allowed in the building, we have to pick up and drop off outside. I'm also comfortable with them following through because they stayed closed through April and most of May when they could have opened under their emergency license because they weren't comfortable yet with their preparedness or the general conditions in the state. They didn't collect any tuition or ask for payment to hold spots during that time, they took a huge financial hit when they probably didn't have to because they were concerned about doing things safely.

Two: If my child was in elementary school I'd probably be keeping him home and doing virtual learning. But he's only two. This is an absolutely critical age for emotional and social growth and that's something I can't do at home. I can do it with a neighborhood cohort perhaps, but that's not really any better than where he is now in my opinion. The risk is probably comparable given the size of his class at school, if not more given I don't know that other parents are deep cleaning their homes every day. Also he'd be getting taught by parents rather than professionals. I hope the fact that I'm willing to send my kid to day care right now says way more about how important I think the benefits of day care/school is than how little I'm worried about COVID. The difference in progress now that he's back in class versus when he was home in April/May is enormous. Also, both my wife and I are essential workers. I do work from home part of the time and could take care of him, but at two years old it's really difficult to work while caring for him. You can only park him in front of the iPad for so long.

With all that said, I plan to pull him back out if our region gets bad enough to require mitigation measures. It's a risk-reward decision. Right now the risk is worth the reward. If things look like they're spiking again then that will change.",anti-mitigation,unclear,pro-mitigation,unclear

"Ok so here’s my two cents on mask wearing. 

I have C-PTSD and a history of contamination OCD, both of these things have gotten much more manageable in recent years but the OCD is definitely flared up in this pandemic. I’m on pretty high alert when I’m outdoors. I’ve been fortunate enough to have money to get groceries delivered (well... I have to use my student loan money) and haven’t stepped foot in any business since March 14th. When sheltering in place first started around that time, I didn’t wear a mask. As soon as it started being talked about more seriously sometime in April before Easter, I panicked and made one from a T-shirt. It was loose and weird. I made a second one. I could barely breathe through it. I ordered one. It was too big for my face. A friend sent me a medical one. I wore it on a rainy day and it was ruined fast. 

The one that is too big I have been using daily anyway, I tie it in the back with an elastic band to make it fit. I wear glasses and have been through the whole figuring out how to make it stop fogging them ordeal. I have gotten more used to breathing with it on and it has become somewhat second nature. It does take time to get used to and there’s a chance many of us CAN get used to them. They become less burdensome. I have hated wearing it and I’m finally starting to make peace with. It sucks! I know! But this entire situation does so I have little patience for people who don’t wear them for no other reason than that. 

I wear mine when I take walks. I live in Chicago. So many walks have been ruined by the people around me wearing no masks because they think it’s ok since they’re outdoors. I get your logic. But sidewalks can be narrow. People for some reason rarely distance themselves from me in or near walkways. People sometimes absentmindedly forget to make sure there’s six feet of room between us. I am consistently the only person actually getting over. I don’t get it. 

When you’re wearing a mask you are, more than anything, helping the people AROUND you, you’re protecting them, not yourself. This means you then have to rely on THEM to protect YOU. I know it sucks, but please, if you can, just wear the mask. At this point it’s just better safe than sorry and we all have to rely on each other. I am doing everything I can regardless of what a pain in the ass it is so can you please help me out and do the same? Plus, it would really help with my panic while trying to get some outdoor time.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation
"So one person in your party had the virus, and exposed the rest of you in close proximity to them for a long period of time to what was likely a very high dose of the actual virus, and you're surprised almost everyone else caught it? That's not how vaccines work. 

No vaccine is 100% effective. Just because it is 95% effective doesn't mean there's only a 5% chance you will catch it. You were exposed at a high concentration, dropping the effectiveness of the vaccine significantly. Incidental exposure would not have resulted in infection. Party bus with a viral plume of covid-19?

"No. At this point, I think it's pretty reasonable messaging that the CDC put out there, one that acknowledges the realities of the situation. (There's a first time for everything!). 

The social end of the pandemic is here. Case rates are dropping like a rock, hospitals are nowhere even approaching overwhelmed, and the vast majority of the elderly and high risk have been vaccinated. Compliance with masks and distancing were going to be rapidly dropping as we get into summer anyways; the increasing millions and millions of fully-vaccinated people weren't just going to sit around forever waiting for the official OK to take their masks off. 

At this point, the CDC can at least make a public statement like this and control the message a little bit. If you're vaccinated, take off your mask; if you're not, you should keep wearing one; and, if you're on the fence or were waiting, get it done because we're done waiting for you. If they kept waiting for weeks or months, more and more people would just give up anyways. Wait Two More Weeks(tm) wore out its welcome in April of 2020. 

Are there people who will take unfairly advantage of it? Yep. Is there anything that anyone can do about it? Nope.

> However, because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Marek's is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low. Decades after the first vaccine was introduced, current strains of Marek Virus cause lymphoma formation on throughout the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens. The Marek's disease vaccine is a leaky vaccine, which means that only the symptoms of the disease are prevented.[11] Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented. Under normal conditions, highly virulent strains of the virus are not selected. A highly virulent strain would kill the host before the virus would have an opportunity to transmit to other potential hosts and replicate. Thus, less virulent strains are selected. These strains are virulent enough to induce symptoms but not enough to kill the host, allowing further transmission. However, the leaky vaccine changes this evolutionary pressure and permits the evolution of highly virulent strains.[12] The vaccine's inability to prevent infection and transmission allows the spread of highly virulent strains among vaccinated chickens. The fitness of the more virulent strains is increased by the vaccine.",pro-mitigation,anti-mitigation,anti-mitigation,anti-mitigation

I think it’s foolish for a number of reasons. We should continue to wear masks unless we’re mostly sure that we can go back to living normally.

1. There are an increasing amount of variations of the COVID-19 strain. The strain you may have been vaccinated against would probably be less effective against a new strain. (I hope this doesn’t happen)
2. The COVID vaccines, while incredibly helpful, don’t offer full immunity towards the virus. The vaccines teach our body to recognize the virus so if the time comes, your body would stand a better chance at fighting the virus and surviving without any lasting damages (hopefully), and hopefully making it less lethal towards you than if you were unvaccinated, increasing your chances of survival. (It’s still dangerous though)
3. Even if you’re vaccinated, you could still carry the virus in some way and spread it to others, whether they be vaccinated or not (like children). And the same could happen to you.
4. Masks offer protection towards you and for others. There are other airborne illnesses varying in severity that a mask and proper safety techniques could protect you from.

I do hope that one day soon we can get things back to normal (or better) and I don’t want other to continue suffering, and for things to be safe again, which I pray for, but this is something that we have to be smart about, so on with the mask-wearing and following proper safety precautions and the prayers.",pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation,pro-mitigation

My husband had to go into the eye doctor to pick up glasses yesterday. They had a sign on the door indicating masks were not required. He is fully vaccinated but wore a mask anyways.

We heard so much about portable temporary hospitals and other facilities in the beginning but now the mask mandates have taken over. 
Although masks help slow transmission there are probably other reasons why the virus is spreading throughout many regions. For one, every area was shutdown without thought as to whether the Coronavirus actually was a threat. Now it is spreading to more places not hit before.

They can’t transmit it but can catch it? The cdc flip flops so many times I wish they would’ve kept the mask mandates in place.

Still wear my mask at the lab because it's required.

I still wear my mask in stores mainly as a courtesy to the workers -- they don't know if I'm vaccinated and I don't know if they have conditions preventing vaccination.

No, but if it makes others more comfortable at literally no cost to myself, then obviously I'm going to do it. That also seems to be the general attitude around my area -- my local Trader Joe's doesn't require masks but I've seen literally *one* person all month that wasn't wearing it, and this is in an area with very high vaccination rate.
