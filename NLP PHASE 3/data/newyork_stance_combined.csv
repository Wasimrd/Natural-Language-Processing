Many who question the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines are misinterpreting the data. For example, people confuse a vaccine’s 95% efficacy rate from a controlled study with the notion that 5 out of 100 vaccinated people in the general population are vulnerable to breakthrough infection. Not so.

Real-world breakthrough infections are reported by The Lancet as the following percentages per vaccine: 0.9% for the Pfizer–BioNTech, 1% for the Gamaleya, 1·4% for the Moderna–NIH, 1·8% for the J&J, and 1·9% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccines. In the real world, the odds of a vaccinated person becoming infected are between 1 and 2 out of 100. And when infection happens, the vaccines practically eliminate the progression of advanced Covid requiring hospitalization.

The last unknown, asymptomatic infection, has not emerged among the vaccinated. And, the mRNA vaccines can handle the variants so far. Put all this together with the vaccines’ excellent safety record, and the case for vaccination is overwhelming.

"Having been vaccinated and currently WFH but waiting to return to office, I want my employer to require all employees to be vaccinated.  Understanding the challenges of making vaccines a requirement, especially since Trump made masks and vaccines a political issue, the alternative is to require every employee returning to the office to be vaccinated OR receive negative result from a weekly approved PCR test, and answer a series of daily health and social behavior questions in order to get an “approved for office” today. Moreover, vaccines and weekly testing requirements should, in my opinion, be extended not just to return to work but to all business activities, including travel and all internal/external meetings.

My employer is not planning to require vaccines or testing when offices reopen, rather it will rely on local infection data to make decisions, which are lagging statistics. Such an approach makes no sense to me as I believe wide spread return to office requirements without simultaneously requiring employees to be vaccinated will result in increased infections, which will lead to more variants. I imagine others feel like I do... I do not want to return to a life of no social interaction because a breakthrough variant has made the current vaccines ineffective.

Our occasional recent forays into local favorites have found them virtually empty, otherwise we wouldn't go in.  Easy to maintain social distancing under those circumstances; hard to see how long they can remain in business.

Third, mask usage in stores now seems ubiquitous, a good thing.

There are no other vaccines that are required that do not have full approval.  To compare one of the Covid vaccines (which is EUA) to any other vaccine (with a BLA) like MMR, polio, pneumonia, flu, etc. is not a valid comparison because they are all fully approved.

For example, there are different evidentiary requirements for licensure of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and issuance of an EUA for a vaccine. Furthermore, an EUA expires upon termination of the relevant emergency declaration, whereas there is no “termination” of a BLA.

That is where all the cases are coming from.  A son who was an actively working doctor in South Florida, passed on the virus to his father, a retired physician, and both of them died.  In other words, the virus is so contagious, and often deadly to many healthcare personnel, who are subjected to a high virus count, day in, and day out.  Every contact with more than 2, presents more its own dangers.  Most nursing home residents who died were given the virus by those who worked in those institutions.

The vaccines for Covid, however have not been found to be safe by the FDA, its use has been allowed only through an emergency use authorization. 

The FDA explains the reason for its emergency use authorization because 1. Covid 19 ""can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition"", and 2. ""the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine when used to prevent Covid outweigh its known and potential risks"".

So not only was it not approved to be safe, its use was allowed only because the benefit of being protected from ""a serious or life-threatening disease"" ""outweigh the known and potential risks"" of the vaccine.

As such a young and healthy person for whom Covid does not pose a serious risk of a ""life-threatening disease"" is fully within his rights to claim that not only has the FDA never approved the vaccine to be safe, but that since Covid does not pose a significant risk of ""a serious or life-threatening disease"" to him, therefore his taking the vaccine does not necessarily outweigh ""the known and potential risks"" of the vaccine.

If vaccine protection is transient or increasingly ineffective as new variants emerge, or if a substantial number of our fellows remain available to keep it propagating, then we’ll need ongoing public health measures for everyone’s protection. We can certainly try incentives first, but at some point there will have to be mandates much like there are for public school attendance. Ideally vaccines will also need formal approvals beyond EUA’s.

We should also remember that some of those vaccinated won’t be adequately protected. People who’ve had strong chemotherapy or take powerful immunosuppressives for autoimmune diseases or have one of the many congenital immune deficiencies (and there are millions) can safely get a vaccine that’s not a live virus, but can still remain extremely vulnerable to Covid. And a small percentage of healthy vaccinees can still get infected. A fully vaccinated Golden State Warrior player recently came out and described how seriously ill he’s been for the last few weeks, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. 

Covid 19 is no joke and I have no respect for those who choose to be uninformed and an ongoing threat to their fellows. Try the carrot and maybe we’ll get lucky enough with that. But at some point it’s likely the greater good will require sacrifices or penalties so we can all move on.",unclear

Cases have drastically fallen to the lowest levels since testing was widely available. The Delta variant is more transmissible but there is not a lot of concrete data proving that its more deadly. It has this scary sounding name and gets hyped up by the media, but in reality its just Covid. Im not afraid of Covid, and no one is going to scare me with media hype. As an MIT-educated biologist, I know data. And data shows that Delta is not some new scary thing but rather just another version of the same disease we have been dealing with for 18 months. Sure, its more transmissible. But viruses generally evolve to become more transmissible and less deadly. Covid will do the same. By the time we get to the Omega variant we will have a common cold.

There are already many precedents for arguably worse invasions of privacy in the corporate world, including mandatory drug testing (ie. urine tests) and intrusive personal background and credit checks during hiring.

In the short term, unvaccinated employees prolong the pandemic and endanger not just themselves but their customers and coworkers as well.

On a broader level, declining to take a free vaccine that has proved incredibly safe and effective in the midst of a deadly pandemic shows a staggering lack of good judgement. If an airline attendant, for example, won't take this common-sense precaution to protect themselves and others, how can I be sure they will make a better judgement call in the event of an in-flight emergency?

Restaurants can usually accommodate rules about separation of tables, though sometimes at the cost of capacity and therefore of revenue.  But a bar that required its patrons to observe social distancing would have a very hard time operating at all.

Hoping your message applies to fellow teachers, administrators, staff, and volunteers.

Some major school districts in CA, including those that serve large populations of POC families, are good at requiring adults to provide proof of negative TB tests, but refuse even to ask teachers, staff, et al about vaccine status, let alone require vaccination.

These people are paid with public funds and should be required to follow public health guidance.  And since families are required by law to enroll their children in school, they are now faced with the “choice” of breaking the law or sending still-vulnerable children to spend 6-plus hours a day with adults who may not be vaccinated and who may be asymptomatically spreading ever more dangerous variants to children and coworkers and the families they go home to.  

While it appears that, statistically, and so far schools haven’t been sources of many super-spreader incidents, it doesn’t mean it never happens.

These new viral variants may be more virulent and may not succumb to vaccines developed for older variants. 

In order to protect the population as a whole, steps need to be taken. If we can insist on insurance for all drivers, the wearing of wearing safety belts, fines for texting while driving, designated non-smoking areas, higher premiums for smokers or those frequently involved in accidents, then we can bring similar tools into play for covid-19. 

For example, vaccination resisters could face higher medical insurance premiums, banning from the workplace, or denial of access to stores and public places, enforced by fines.

R0 was way under one the  restaurant owners were so happy to be allowed to reopen that you could see that they were serious about taking precautions.

Now the numbers are up and I don’t trust restaurateurs any more and since many waiters are young I have no way to know if they weren’t partying in large crowds on their day off.

"I would be strongly against the idea of mandating these COVID-19 vaccines but I think providing incentives to get vaccinated is a good idea.  One reason that comes to mind for why I think it would be very irresponsible to mandate is that there is not yet any long-term safety data on these vaccines.  

Maybe there are no serious long-term side effects that will emerge or maybe the chance of serious long-term side effects is very low, but at this point it is too early to know.  

I might feel differently about mandating a vaccine after it has already been properly tested over the long-term to show that there are no serious adverse long-term side effects.  Even then I would only support mandating under certain circumstances (ie: to travel internationally, to work in certain health care professions, etc.)",pro-mitigation

"This article is about where outbreaks have come from, but I don't think the headline that bars and restaurant owners wanted to get back to work is accurate. Bars and restaurant owners have felt compelled to reopen in some capacity due to the lack of support required at the state or federal level (PPP has been problematic and not the financial or legislative fix needed to save bars and restaurants). The effort required to pivot a million times, keep employees safe, and try to meet pre-pandemic expectations from guests has created constant stress, and it's not profitable. And because the take out only scenario is really, really not profitable, we end up with businesses making irresponsible decisions about dine-in. But when the alternative is shutting down, defaulting on one's lease, and risking a lawsuit from the property owner (a real threat), what does one do but keep going?

I found your article quite useful, but feel the word “disagree” is unhelpful in describing differing positions between WHO and CDC.

The WHO must make recommendations to a more heterogeneous world of sometimes more poorly characterized and/or regulated vaccines with variably worse performance. Thus, while their recommendations may differ, that does not mean that they disagree.",unclear

"To the commenters who have “done their part” by masking up in the past and have gotten vaccinated, saying Covid is no longer their problem - especially for those who won’t get shots:

Do you think you are any better than all the anti-masksers we have had since the pandemic began?

Yes, it is frustrating that many do want to be vaccinated. But it doesn’t mean I want them to get very ill or die, let alone possibly indirectly play a role in filling up hospitals, thus repeating a cycle we had last year: traumatized and burnt out medical professionals, and those who do need other medical help reluctant to seek the care they need. 

What about those with compromised immune systems who can’t get shots? Or those of age, as the NYTimes covered, who have family preventing them from getting vaccinated? Children who can then spread to adults? There are so many people out there who can suffer, because of the choices you make - not just the choices they make for themselves. 

It’s mental gymnastics. The amount of faith so many politicians and people have put in the CDC is astounding - how many mistakes have they made in the past year? How many times have they flip-flopped and kowtowed because it fits the “thinking” that so many want to hear?

Trump was our President. Surely since he was an “authority,” so many more should have just blindly trusted him?

"There’s a misperception regarding how to manage a pandemic. Even states that slowly and responsibly reopened following guidelines did not do so expecting zero new cases. The initial lockdown (flattening of the curve) was intended to prevent the breakdown of the health care system. It was intended to be followed by a slow, cautious deliberate reopening where spikes could occur. Italy, Spain, Germany are all experiencing this. The virus cannot be eliminated, it can only be controlled. The health system, except for a handful of places, has not been overburdened and the death rates have continued to drop. This has happened despite Trump and his cronies. The conventional wisdom ignores the dire mental, physical and financial consequences of not reopening.",anti-mitigation
"So, we are told to continue wearing masks and social distancing, and in some places, implementing restrictions or lockdowns…even though we were told that we should get the vaccine, that it’s safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death.

And if it isn’t actually effective, then why I am getting a new (created in under a year), experimental, not fully FDA approved vaccine if nothing in my life changes, and I have to continue to social distance and mask? (Which is not healthy or normal for humans biologically wired to be social creatures). Businesses have been destroyed, poverty is worse, mental health issues are off the charts…..
And also, another thing I’ve thought about. Is it my duty as a vaccinated person to give up my life and freedoms to protect a person who chooses to not get a vaccine and may possibly get Covid and have a higher chance of dying? Perhaps there are some bleeding heart liberals who say, yes, it’s our job to protect the foolish. That’s nice of you, but there are a lot of people who disagree, including myself. 

There are risks in everything we do. I chose to take the risk of getting an unapproved vaccine even though there is a chance of developing health issues (blood clots or heart issues). I weighed it against the risks of getting Covid, and decided the risks seemed lower for the vaccine. I have friends/family who came to the opposite conclusion. People disagree.

"Some observations from an elderly South Floridian:

First, the recent surge down here --now apparently easing-- is predominantly due to teens and millennials partying.  Closing the bars --obviously a sensible notion -- moved the drinkathons to private residences.

Second, all restaurants are not the same.  Many don't serve alcoholic beverages, ergo they don't attract crowds.  Our occasional recent forays into local favorites have found them virtually empty, otherwise we wouldn't go in.  Easy to maintain social distancing under those circumstances; hard to see how long they can remain in business.

Third, mask usage in stores now seems ubiquitous, a good thing.  I do wish the media would let their readers know a dirty little secret from the contact tracers:  They focus on prolonged exposure --five to fifteen minutes -- at close quarters.
